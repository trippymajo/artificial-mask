## One kitten. Many disguises. Dress smart. Think smarter.

Guise Club is a game about masks, identity, and pretending to belong. You play as a curious kitten trying to infiltrate secretive places such as a neon nightclub, a hidden cult, and a mysterious level inspired by the «Blade Runner 2049 test». Each mission begins with a briefing that hints at the nature of the location and its unspoken rules. Before entering, you must choose the right outfit for your character, because appearance is everything. At the entrance, you are confronted by an AI gatekeeper that analyzes how well you fit in. Through dialogue and logical reasoning, you must convince the neural network that your look matches the expectations of the place. Wearing the wrong clothes or making weak arguments may expose you instantly. The core gameplay revolves around deduction, experimentation, and social deception rather than combat. Every location has its own aesthetic logic, hidden criteria, and atmosphere. The AI does not judge who you truly are, only the mask you present. As you progress, the game subtly questions whether identity is defined by essence or performance. Guise Club is a short but thoughtful experience about blending in, standing out, and surviving by wearing the right mask at the right time.
